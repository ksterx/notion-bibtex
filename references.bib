                   is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is
                   well suited for problems that are large in terms of data

               Convolutional Neural Fields}",
  author    = "Liu, Fayao and Shen, Chunhua and Lin, Guosheng and Reid, Ian",
  abstract  = "In this article, we tackle the problem of depth estimation from
               single monocular images. Compared with depth estimation using
               multiple images such as stereo depth perception, depth from
               monocular images is much more challenging. Prior work typically
               focuses on exploiting geometric priors or additional sources of
               information, most using hand-crafted features. Recently, there
               is mounting evidence that features from deep convolutional
               neural networks (CNN) set new records for various vision
               applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous
               characteristic of the depth values, depth estimation can be
               naturally formulated as a continuous conditional random field
               (CRF) learning problem. Therefore, here we present a deep
               convolutional neural field model for estimating depths from
               single monocular images, aiming to jointly explore the capacity
               of deep CNN and continuous CRF. In particular, we propose a deep
               structured learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise
               potentials of continuous CRF in a unified deep CNN framework. We
               then further propose an equally effective model based on fully
               convolutional networks and a novel superpixel pooling method,
               which is about 10 times faster, to speedup the patch-wise
               convolutions in the deep model. With this more efficient model,
               we are able to design deeper networks to pursue better
               performance. Our proposed method can be used for depth
               estimation of general scenes with no geometric priors nor any
               extra information injected. In our case, the integral of the
               partition function can be calculated in a closed form such that
               we can exactly solve the log-likelihood maximization. Moreover,
               solving the inference problem for predicting depths of a test
               image is highly efficient as closed-form solutions exist.
               Experiments on both indoor and outdoor scene datasets
               demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
               state-of-the-art depth estimation approaches.",

               depth of up to 152 layers - 8$\times$ deeper than VGG nets [40]

  abstract      = "Learning with non-modular losses is an important problem
                   when sets of predictions are made simultaneously. The main
                   tools for constructing convex surrogate loss functions for
                   set prediction are margin rescaling and slack rescaling. In
                   this work, we show that these strategies lead to tight
                   convex surrogates iff the underlying loss function is
                   increasing in the number of incorrect predictions. However,
                   gradient or cutting-plane computation for these functions is
                   NP-hard for non-supermodular loss functions. We propose
                   instead a novel surrogate loss function for submodular
                   losses, the Lov\textbackslash'asz hinge, which leads to O(p

              databases and the optimization of real-time operating room
              scheduling, among others. As a result, surgical phase recognition
              has been studied in the context of several kinds of surgeries,
              such as cataract, neurological, and laparoscopic surgeries. In
              the literature, two types of features are typically used to
              perform this task: visual features and tool usage signals.
              However, the used visual features are mostly handcrafted.
              Furthermore, the tool usage signals are usually collected via a
              manual annotation process or by using additional equipment. In
              this paper, we propose a novel method for phase recognition that
              uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically learn
              features from cholecystectomy videos and that relies uniquely on

                   networks showing that they can be seen as a collection of
                   many paths of differing length. Moreover, residual networks
                   seem to enable very deep networks by leveraging only the
                   short paths during training. To support this observation, we
                   rewrite residual networks as an explicit collection of
                   paths. Unlike traditional models, paths through residual
                   networks vary in length. Further, a lesion study reveals
                   that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense
                   that they do not strongly depend on each other. Finally, and
                   most surprising, most paths are shorter than one might
                   expect, and only the short paths are needed during training,
                   as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example,
                   most of the gradient in a residual network with 110 layers
                   comes from paths that are only 10-34 layers deep. Our
                   results reveal one of the key characteristics that seem to

                   proposed class of generative models in which a generator is
                   trained to optimize a cost function that is being
                   simultaneously learned by a discriminator. While the idea of
                   learning cost functions is relatively new to the field of
                   generative modeling, learning costs has long been studied in
                   control and reinforcement learning (RL) domains, typically
                   for imitation learning from demonstrations. In these fields,
                   learning cost function underlying observed behavior is known
                   as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) or inverse optimal
                   control. While at first the connection between cost learning
                   in RL and cost learning in generative modeling may appear to
                   be a superficial one, we show in this paper that certain IRL
                   methods are in fact mathematically equivalent to GANs. In
                   particular, we demonstrate an equivalence between a
                   sample-based algorithm for maximum entropy IRL and a GAN in
                   which the generator's density can be evaluated and is
                   provided as an additional input to the discriminator.
                   Interestingly, maximum entropy IRL is a special case of an
                   energy-based model. We discuss the interpretation of GANs as
                   an algorithm for training energy-based models, and relate
                   this interpretation to other recent work that seeks to
                   connect GANs and EBMs. By formally highlighting the

                   exploited to improve machine throughput. In this paper, we
                   review common assumptions on learning rate scaling and
                   training duration, as a basis for an experimental comparison
                   of test performance for different mini-batch sizes. We adopt
                   a learning rate that corresponds to a constant average

                   learning rates. BN avoids this problem by constantly
                   correcting activations to be zero-mean and of unit standard
                   deviation, which enables larger gradient steps, yields
                   faster convergence and may help bypass sharp local minima.
                   We further show various ways in which gradients and
                   activations of deep unnormalized networks are ill-behaved.
                   We contrast our results against recent findings in random
                   matrix theory, shedding new light on classical
                   initialization schemes and their consequences.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: With the advent of robot-assisted surgery, the role of
               data-driven approaches to integrate statistics and machine
               learning is growing rapidly with prominent interests in
               objective surgical skill assessment. However, most existing work
               requires translating robot motion kinematics into intermediate
               features or gesture segments that are expensive to extract, lack
               efficiency, and require significant domain-specific knowledge.
               METHODS: We propose an analytical deep learning framework for
               skill assessment in surgical training. A deep convolutional
               neural network is implemented to map multivariate time series
               data of the motion kinematics to individual skill levels.
               RESULTS: We perform experiments on the public minimally invasive
               surgical robotic dataset, JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment
               Working Set (JIGSAWS). Our proposed learning model achieved
               competitive accuracies of 92.5\%, 95.4\%, and 91.3\%, in the
               standard training tasks: Suturing, Needle-passing, and
               Knot-tying, respectively. Without the need of engineered
               features or carefully tuned gesture segmentation, our model can
               successfully decode skill information from raw motion profiles
               via end-to-end learning. Meanwhile, the proposed model is able
               to reliably interpret skills within a 1-3 second window, without
               needing an observation of entire training trial. CONCLUSION:
               This study highlights the potential of deep architectures for
               efficient online skill assessment in modern surgical training.",

  abstract = "Driven by recent computer vision and robotic applications,
              recovering 3D human poses has become increasingly important and
              attracted growing interests. In fact, completing this task is
              quite challenging due to the diverse appearances, viewpoints,
              occlusions and inherently geometric ambiguities inside monocular
              images. Most of the existing methods focus on designing some
              elaborate priors /constraints to directly regress 3D human poses
              based on the corresponding 2D human pose-aware features or 2D
              pose predictions. However, due to the insufficient 3D pose data
              for training and the domain gap between 2D space and 3D space,
              these methods have limited scalabilities for all practical
              scenarios (e.g., outdoor scene). Attempt to address this issue,
              this paper proposes a simple yet effective self-supervised
              correction mechanism to learn all intrinsic structures of human
              poses from abundant images. Specifically, the proposed mechanism
              involves two dual learning tasks, i.e., the 2D-to-3D pose
              transformation and 3D-to-2D pose projection, to serve as a bridge
              between 3D and 2D human poses in a type of ``free''
              self-supervision for accurate 3D human pose estimation. The
              2D-to-3D pose implies to sequentially regress intermediate 3D
              poses by transforming the pose representation from the 2D domain
              to the 3D domain under the sequence-dependent temporal context,
              while the 3D-to-2D pose projection contributes to refining the
              intermediate 3D poses by maintaining geometric consistency
              between the 2D projections of 3D poses and the estimated 2D
              poses. Therefore, these two dual learning tasks enable our model
              to adaptively learn from 3D human pose data and external
              large-scale 2D human pose data. We further apply our
              self-supervised correction mechanism to develop a 3D human pose
              machine, which jointly integrates the 2D spatial relationship,
              temporal smoothness of predictions and 3D geometric knowledge.

                   presenting the first open-sourced reinforcement learning

                   available at https://github.com/ucsdarclab/dVRL\}. Through
                   the proposed RL environments, which are functionally
                   equivalent to Gym, we show that it is easy to prototype and
                   implement state-of-art RL algorithms on surgical robotics

                   tasks during surgery. Learned policies are furthermore
                   successfully transferable to a real robot. Finally,
                   combining dVRL with the over 40+ international network of da
                   Vinci Surgical Research Kits in active use at academic
                   institutions, we see dVRL as enabling the broad surgical
                   robotics community to fully leverage the newest strategies
                   in reinforcement learning, and for reinforcement learning

                   and develop new algorithms that can solve the real-world,

  abstract      = "Imitation learning targets deriving a mapping from states to
                   actions, a.k.a. policy, from expert demonstrations. Existing
                   methods for imitation learning typically require any actions
                   in the demonstrations to be fully available, which is hard
                   to ensure in real applications. Though algorithms for
                   learning with unobservable actions have been proposed, they
                   focus solely on state information and overlook the fact that
                   the action sequence could still be partially available and
                   provide useful information for policy deriving. In this
                   paper, we propose a novel algorithm called Action-Guided
                   Adversarial Imitation Learning (AGAIL) that learns a policy
                   from demonstrations with incomplete action sequences, i.e.,
                   incomplete demonstrations. The core idea of AGAIL is to
                   separate demonstrations into state and action trajectories,
                   and train a policy with state trajectories while using
                   actions as auxiliary information to guide the training
                   whenever applicable. Built upon the Generative Adversarial
                   Imitation Learning, AGAIL has three components: a generator,
                   a discriminator, and a guide. The generator learns a policy
                   with rewards provided by the discriminator, which tries to
                   distinguish state distributions between demonstrations and
                   samples generated by the policy. The guide provides
                   additional rewards to the generator when demonstrated
                   actions for specific states are available. We compare AGAIL
                   to other methods on benchmark tasks and show that AGAIL
                   consistently delivers comparable performance to the
                   state-of-the-art methods even when the action sequence in

  abstract      = "Human motion prediction, i.e., forecasting future body poses
                   given observed pose sequence, has typically been tackled
                   with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, as evidenced
                   by prior work, the resulted RNN models suffer from
                   prediction errors accumulation, leading to undesired
                   discontinuities in motion prediction. In this paper, we
                   propose a simple feed-forward deep network for motion
                   prediction, which takes into account both temporal
                   smoothness and spatial dependencies among human body joints.
                   In this context, we then propose to encode temporal
                   information by working in trajectory space, instead of the
                   traditionally-used pose space. This alleviates us from
                   manually defining the range of temporal dependencies (or
                   temporal convolutional filter size, as done in previous
                   work). Moreover, spatial dependency of human pose is encoded
                   by treating a human pose as a generic graph (rather than a
                   human skeletal kinematic tree) formed by links between every
                   pair of body joints. Instead of using a pre-defined graph
                   structure, we design a new graph convolutional network to
                   learn graph connectivity automatically. This allows the
                   network to capture long range dependencies beyond that of
                   human kinematic tree. We evaluate our approach on several
                   standard benchmark datasets for motion prediction, including
                   Human3.6M, the CMU motion capture dataset and 3DPW. Our
                   experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed approach
                   achieves state of the art performance, and is applicable to
                   both angle-based and position-based pose representations.

                   successfully applied to the RL setting. In this work we
                   demonstrate that the standard transformer architecture is
                   difficult to optimize, which was previously observed in the
                   supervised learning setting but becomes especially
                   pronounced with RL objectives. We propose architectural
                   modifications that substantially improve the stability and
                   learning speed of the original Transformer and XL variant.
                   The proposed architecture, the Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL),
                   surpasses LSTMs on challenging memory environments and
                   achieves state-of-the-art results on the multi-task DMLab-30
                   benchmark suite, exceeding the performance of an external
                   memory architecture. We show that the GTrXL, trained using
                   the same losses, has stability and performance that
                   consistently matches or exceeds a competitive LSTM baseline,
                   including on more reactive tasks where memory is less
                   critical. GTrXL offers an easy-to-train, simple-to-implement
                   but substantially more expressive architectural alternative
                   to the standard multi-layer LSTM ubiquitously used for RL

  abstract      = "In many settings, it is desirable to learn decision-making
                   and control policies through learning or bootstrapping from
                   expert demonstrations. The most common approaches under this
                   Imitation Learning (IL) framework are Behavioural Cloning
                   (BC), and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). Recent
                   methods for IRL have demonstrated the capacity to learn
                   effective policies with access to a very limited set of
                   demonstrations, a scenario in which BC methods often fail.
                   Unfortunately, due to multiple factors of variation,
                   directly comparing these methods does not provide adequate
                   intuition for understanding this difference in performance.
                   In this work, we present a unified probabilistic perspective
                   on IL algorithms based on divergence minimization. We
                   present $f$-MAX, an $f$-divergence generalization of AIRL
                   [Fu et al., 2018], a state-of-the-art IRL method. $f$-MAX
                   enables us to relate prior IRL methods such as GAIL [Ho \&
                   Ermon, 2016] and AIRL [Fu et al., 2018], and understand
                   their algorithmic properties. Through the lens of divergence
                   minimization we tease apart the differences between BC and
                   successful IRL approaches, and empirically evaluate these
                   nuances on simulated high-dimensional continuous control
                   domains. Our findings conclusively identify that IRL's
                   state-marginal matching objective contributes most to its
                   superior performance. Lastly, we apply our new understanding
                   of IL methods to the problem of state-marginal matching,
                   where we demonstrate that in simulated arm pushing
                   environments we can teach agents a diverse range of
                   behaviours using simply hand-specified state distributions
                   and no reward functions or expert demonstrations. For

               such surgical tasks is the temporal perception of the current
               surgical scene, which requires a real-time estimation of the

                   ``SOLO: segmenting objects by locations''. Importantly, we
                   take one step further by dynamically learning the mask head
                   of the object segmenter such that the mask head is
                   conditioned on the location. Specifically, the mask branch
                   is decoupled into a mask kernel branch and mask feature
                   branch, which are responsible for learning the convolution
                   kernel and the convolved features respectively. Moreover, we
                   propose Matrix NMS (non maximum suppression) to
                   significantly reduce the inference time overhead due to NMS

                   undergone rapid growth with the development of robotics and
                   imaging systems. Innovations in vision, haptics and accurate
                   movements of robot arms have enabled surgeons to perform
                   precise minimally invasive surgeries. Real-time semantic
                   segmentation of the robotic instruments and tissues is a
                   crucial step in robot-assisted surgery. Accurate and
                   efficient segmentation of the surgical scene not only aids
                   in the identification and tracking of instruments but also
                   provided contextual information about the different tissues
                   and instruments being operated with. For this purpose, we
                   have developed a light-weight cascaded convolutional neural
                   network (CNN) to segment the surgical instruments from
                   high-resolution videos obtained from a commercial robotic
                   system. We propose a multi-resolution feature fusion module
                   (MFF) to fuse the feature maps of different dimensions and
                   channels from the auxiliary and main branch. We also
                   introduce a novel way of combining auxiliary loss and
                   adversarial loss to regularize the segmentation model.
                   Auxiliary loss helps the model to learn low-resolution
                   features, and adversarial loss improves the segmentation
                   prediction by learning higher order structural information.
                   The model also consists of a light-weight spatial pyramid
                   pooling (SPP) unit to aggregate rich contextual information
                   in the intermediate stage. We show that our model surpasses
                   existing algorithms for pixel-wise segmentation of surgical
                   instruments in both prediction accuracy and segmentation

                   model-based control methods that must account for
                   deformation dynamics during tissue manipulation. Previous
                   works in vision-based perception can capture the geometric
                   changes within the scene, however, integration with dynamic
                   properties toachieve accurate and safe model-based
                   controllers has not been considered before. Considering the
                   mechanic coupling between the robot and the environment, it
                   is crucial to develop a registered, simulated dynamical
                   model. In this work, we propose an online, continuous,
                   real-to-sim registration method to bridge from 3D visual
                   perception to position-based dynamics(PBD) modeling of

                   used to register and update the simulation, accounting for
                   differences between the simulation and the real world. To

               additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual

               promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of
               supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of
               predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient
               and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from
               scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs
               collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural
               language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or
               describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to
               downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by
               benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision

                   manipulators to deform the plasticine into the desired

                   The simulator augments the finite element method (FEM) with

                   object manipulation leveraging a deep neural network called
                   DeformerNet. Controlling the shape of a 3D object requires
                   an effective state representation that can capture the full
                   3D geometry of the object. Current methods work around this
                   problem by defining a set of feature points on the object or
                   only deforming the object in 2D image space, which does not
                   truly address the 3D shape control problem. Instead, we
                   explicitly use 3D point clouds as the state representation
                   and apply Convolutional Neural Network on point clouds to
                   learn the 3D features. These features are then mapped to the
                   robot end-effector's position using a fully-connected neural

                   harmful -- humans are, for example, able to exploit
                   deformations to generate new potential grasps. How to
                   achieve that on a robot is though an open question. This
                   paper proposes an approach that uses object stiffness
                   information in addition to depth images for synthesizing
                   high-quality grasps. We achieve this by incorporating object
                   stiffness as an additional input to a state-of-the-art deep
                   grasp planning network. We also curate a new synthetic

                   pinching for soft objects and caging for hard objects.

                   abstract concepts? Recent works in manipulation have shown
                   that end-to-end networks can learn dexterous skills that
                   require precise spatial reasoning, but these methods often
                   fail to generalize to new goals or quickly learn
                   transferable concepts across tasks. In parallel, there has
                   been great progress in learning generalizable semantic
                   representations for vision and language by training on
                   large-scale internet data, however these representations
                   lack the spatial understanding necessary for fine-grained
                   manipulation. To this end, we propose a framework that
                   combines the best of both worlds: a two-stream architecture
                   with semantic and spatial pathways for vision-based
                   manipulation. Specifically, we present CLIPort, a
                   language-conditioned imitation-learning agent that combines
                   the broad semantic understanding (what) of CLIP [1] with the
                   spatial precision (where) of Transporter [2]. Our end-to-end
                   framework is capable of solving a variety of
                   language-specified tabletop tasks from packing unseen
                   objects to folding cloths, all without any explicit

               Soft compliant jaw tips are almost universally used with
               parallel-jaw robot grippers due to their ability to increase

                   challenge: the terminated agent must learn from the group's
                   success or failure which occurs beyond its own existence. We
                   refer to propagating value from rewards earned by remaining

                   DextAIRity allows the system to apply dense forces on
                   out-of-contact surfaces, expands the system's reach range,
                   and provides safe high-speed interactions. These properties

                   under-actuated deformable objects with large surface areas

                   knowledge about the world. Such knowledge could be extremely
                   useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level, temporally
                   extended instructions expressed in natural language.
                   However, a significant weakness of language models is that
                   they lack real-world experience, which makes it difficult to
                   leverage them for decision making within a given embodiment.
                   For example, asking a language model to describe how to
                   clean a spill might result in a reasonable narrative, but it
                   may not be applicable to a particular agent, such as a
                   robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular
                   environment. We propose to provide real-world grounding by
                   means of pretrained skills, which are used to constrain the
                   model to propose natural language actions that are both
                   feasible and contextually appropriate. The robot can act as
                   the language model's ``hands and eyes,'' while the language
                   model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task.
                   We show how low-level skills can be combined with large
                   language models so that the language model provides
                   high-level knowledge about the procedures for performing
                   complex and temporally-extended instructions, while value
                   functions associated with these skills provide the grounding
                   necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical
                   environment. We evaluate our method on a number of
                   real-world robotic tasks, where we show the need for

                   industrial and household interaction tasks (e.g., stuffing
                   dumplings, rolling sushi, and making pottery). However, due
                   to the high degree of freedom of elasto-plastic objects,
                   significant challenges exist in virtually every aspect of
                   the robotic manipulation pipeline, e.g., representing the
                   states, modeling the dynamics, and synthesizing the control
                   signals. We propose to tackle these challenges by employing
                   a particle-based representation for elasto-plastic objects
                   in a model-based planning framework. Our system, RoboCraft,
                   only assumes access to raw RGBD visual observations. It
                   transforms the sensing data into particles and learns a
                   particle-based dynamics model using graph neural networks
                   (GNNs) to capture the structure of the underlying system.
                   The learned model can then be coupled with model-predictive
                   control (MPC) algorithms to plan the robot's behavior. We
                   show through experiments that with just 10 minutes of
                   real-world robotic interaction data, our robot can learn a
                   dynamics model that can be used to synthesize control
                   signals to deform elasto-plastic objects into various target
                   shapes, including shapes that the robot has never
                   encountered before. We perform systematic evaluations in
                   both simulation and the real world to demonstrate the
                   robot's manipulation capabilities and ability to generalize
                   to a more complex action space, different tool shapes, and a
                   mixture of motion modes. We also conduct comparisons between
                   RoboCraft and untrained human subjects controlling the
                   gripper to manipulate deformable objects in both simulation
                   and the real world. Our learned model-based planning

                   benefit from the prosperous development of SMs. In this
                   paper, we introduce a novel architecture named Multi-Agent
                   Transformer (MAT) that effectively casts cooperative
                   multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) into SM problems
                   wherein the task is to map agents' observation sequence to
                   agents' optimal action sequence. Our goal is to build the
                   bridge between MARL and SMs so that the modeling power of
                   modern sequence models can be unleashed for MARL. Central to
                   our MAT is an encoder-decoder architecture which leverages
                   the multi-agent advantage decomposition theorem to transform
                   the joint policy search problem into a sequential decision
                   making process; this renders only linear time complexity for
                   multi-agent problems and, most importantly, endows MAT with
                   monotonic performance improvement guarantee. Unlike prior
                   arts such as Decision Transformer fit only pre-collected
                   offline data, MAT is trained by online trials and errors
                   from the environment in an on-policy fashion. To validate
                   MAT, we conduct extensive experiments on StarCraftII,
                   Multi-Agent MuJoCo, Dexterous Hands Manipulation, and Google

                   achieves superior performance and data efficiency compared
                   to strong baselines including MAPPO and HAPPO. Furthermore,
                   we demonstrate that MAT is an excellent few-short learner on

                   alternates between training in simulation and deploying in

                   model and the policy are refined. We evaluate our method on

                   downstream tasks either zero-shot or with small
                   task-specific datasets to a high level of performance. While
                   this capability has been demonstrated in other fields such

                   critical due to the difficulty of collecting real-world

  abstract      = "State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art
                   sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but
                   underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover,
                   despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead
                   of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers
                   due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make
                   progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs
                   and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the
                   hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use
                   synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap
                   between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs
                   struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in
                   the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To
                   understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new
                   SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these
                   abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages
                   and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText.
                   Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that
                   retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms
                   Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the
                   efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose
                   FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to
                   improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a
                   novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent
                   properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv
                   yields 2$\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark
                   and allows hybrid language models to generate text
                   2.4$\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we
                   scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B
                   parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results,
                   achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and
                   outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on
                   a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Bowel injury is a rare but serious complication of
               laparoscopic surgery. This review examines the incidence,
               location, time of diagnosis, causative instruments, management
               and mortality of laparoscopy-induced bowel injury. METHODS: The
               review was carried out using the MeSH browser within PubMed. The
               keywords used were 'laparoscopy/adverse effects' and 'bowel
               perforation'. Additional articles were sourced from references
               within the studies found in the PubMed search. RESULTS: The
               incidence of laparoscopy-induced gastrointestinal injury was
               0.13 per cent (430 of 329 935) and of bowel perforation 0.22 per
               cent (66 of 29 532). The small intestine was most frequently
               injured (55.8 per cent), followed by the large intestine (38.6
               per cent). In at least 66.8 per cent of bowel injuries the
               diagnosis was made during the laparoscopy or within 24 h
               thereafter. A trocar or Veress needle caused the most bowel
               injuries (41.8 per cent), followed by a coagulator or laser
               (25.6 per cent). In 68.9 per cent of instances of bowel injury,
               adhesions or a previous laparotomy were noted. Management was
               mainly by laparotomy (78.6 per cent). The mortality rate
               associated with laparoscopy-induced bowel injury was 3.6 per
               cent. CONCLUSION: At 0.13 per cent, the incidence of
               laparoscopy-induced bowel injury is small and such injury is
               usually discovered during the operation. Nevertheless,
               laparoscopy-induced bowel injury is associated with a high

  abstract  = "This paper systematically describes an interactive dissection
               approach for hybrid soft tissue models governed by extended
               position‐based dynamics. Our framework makes use of a hybrid
               geometric model comprising both surface and volumetric meshes.
               The fine surface triangular mesh with high‐precision geometric
               structure and texture at the detailed level is employed to
               represent the exterior structure of soft tissue models.
               Meanwhile, the interior structure of soft tissues is constructed
               by coarser tetrahedral mesh, which is also employed as physical
               model participating in dynamic simulation. The less details of
               interior structure can effectively reduce the computational cost
               during simulation. For physical deformation, we design and
               implement an extended position‐based dynamics approach that
               supports topology modification and material heterogeneities of
               soft tissue. Besides stretching and volume conservation
               constraints, it enforces the energy preserving constraints,
               which take the different spring stiffness of material into
               account and improve the visual performance of soft tissue
               deformation. Furthermore, we develop mechanical modeling of
               dissection behavior and analyze the system stability. The
               experimental results have shown that our approach affords
               real‐time and robust cutting without sacrificing realistic
               visual performance. Our novel dissection technique has already

              tip by using an endoscopic image. A convolutional neural network
              (CNN) receives the image of the tracked markers attached to the

              RESULTS: The posture estimation results showed that the posture
              estimated from the image followed the electrical sensor. The
              estimated results of the external force calculated based on the

  abstract  = "In colon cancer screening, polyp size estimation using only
               colonoscopy images or videos is difficult even for expert
               physicians although the size information of polyps is important
               for diagnosis. Towards the fully automated computer-aided
               diagnosis (CAD) pipeline, a robust and precise polyp size
               estimation method is highly desired. However, the size
               estimation problem of a three-dimensional object from a
               two-dimensional image is ill-posed due to the lack of
               three-dimensional spatial information. To circumvent this
               challenge, we formulate a relaxed form of size estimation as a
               binary classification problem and solve it by a new deep neural
               network architecture: BseNet. This relaxed form of size
               estimation is defined as a two-category classification: under
               and over a certain polyp dimension criterion that would provoke
               different clinical treatments (resecting the polyp or not).
               BseNet estimates the depth map image from an input colonoscopic
               RGB image using unsupervised deep learning, and integrates RGB
               with the computed depth information to produce a four-channel
               RGB-D imagery data, that is subsequently encoded by BseNet to
               extract deep RGB-D image features and facilitate the size
               classification into two categories: under and over 10 mm polyps.
               For the evaluation of BseNet, a large dataset of colonoscopic
               videos of totally over 16 h is constructed. We evaluate the
               accuracies of both binary polyp size estimation and polyp
               detection performance since detection is a prerequisite step of
               a fully automated CAD system. The experimental results show that
               our proposed BseNet achieves 79.2 \% accuracy for binary
               polyp-size classification. We also combine the image feature
               extraction by BseNet and classification of short video clips
               using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. Polyp detection
               (if the video clip contains a polyp or not) shows 88.8 \%
               sensitivity when employing the spatio-temporal image feature

               difficult imaging conditions are still problematic. In this
               paper, we present a framework for estimating optical flow which
               leads to improvements on these difficult cases by 1) estimating
               occlusions and 2) using additional temporal information. First,
               we divide the image into discrete triangles and show how this
               allows for occluded regions to be naturally estimated and
               directly incorporated into the optimization algorithm. We

              without any risk to the traditional training approaches.
              Electrocautery is one of the essential training tasks in
              laparoscopic cholecystectomy. In order to achieve a high fidelity
              with visual realism in electrocautery simulation, we propose a
              physical-based solution to handle the soft tissue deformation and
              topology change which occurs due to the heat generated by
              electro-hook. The whole computation is built on discrete
              particles. For cholecystectomy simulation, the first task is to
              remove the fat tissue which wraps the cystic artery and duct with
              electro-hook. We use a meshfree method to handle the fat tissue
              deformation which based on continuum elasticity equations. And a
              meshfree dissection model is also introduced to handle the
              thermal transmission when electro-hook touches the fat surface.
              Both models are implemented on GPU to achieve real-time
              performance. The visual performance and computational cost of the
              proposed method are properly evaluated and compared with other
              popularly used approaches. From the experimental results, our
              electrocautery simulation can achieve real-time performance with
              high degree of realism and fidelity. This technique has also been
              adopted in our developed VR-based laparoscopic surgery simulator,

               analyse tissue damage thresholds when the colon is grasped
               laparoscopically, correlating histological changes to mechanical
               compressive forces. METHODS: An instrumented laparoscopic
               grasper was used to measure the forces applied to porcine colon,
               with data captured and plotted as a force-time (f-t) curve.
               Haematoxylin and eosin histochemistry of tissue subjected to 10,
               20, 40, 50 and 70 N for 5, 30 and 60 s was performed, and the
               area of colonic circular and longitudinal muscle was compared in
               grasped and un-grasped regions. The area under the f-t curve was
               calculated as a measure of the accumulated force applied, known
               as the force-time product (FTP). RESULTS: FTP ranged from 55.7
               to 3793 N.s. Significant differences were observed between the
               muscle area of the grasped and un-grasped regions in both
               longitudinal and circular muscle at 50 N and above for all
               grasping times. For the longitudinal muscle, significant
               differences were observed between grasped and un-grasped areas
               at 20 N force for 30 s (mean difference = 59 mm2, 95\% CI 41-77
               mm2, P = 0.04), 20 N force for 60 s (mean difference = 31 mm2,
               95\% CI 21.5-40.5 mm2, P = 0.006) and 40 N force for 30 s (mean
               difference 37 mm2, 95\% CI 27-47 mm2, P = 0.006). Changes in
               histology correlated with mechanical forces applied to the
               longitudinal muscle at a FTP over 300 N s. CONCLUSIONS: This
               study characterizes the grasping forces that result in
               histological changes to the colon and correlates these with a
               mechanical measurement of the applied force. The findings will

              effectiveness of procedures by integrating ML in the operating
              room. METHODS: The review is focused on ML techniques directly
              applied to surgery, surgical robotics, surgical training and
              assessment. The widespread use of ML methods in diagnosis and
              medical image computing is beyond the scope of the review.
              Searches were performed on PubMed and IEEE Explore using
              combinations of keywords: ML, surgery, robotics, surgical and
              medical robotics, skill learning, skill analysis and learning to
              perceive. RESULTS: Studies making use of ML methods in the
              context of surgery are increasingly being reported. In
              particular, there is an increasing interest in using ML for
              developing tools to understand and model surgical skill and
              competence or to extract surgical workflow. Many researchers
              begin to integrate this understanding into the control of recent
              surgical robots and devices. CONCLUSION: ML is an expanding
              field. It is popular as it allows efficient processing of vast
              amounts of data for interpreting and real-time decision making.
              Already widely used in imaging and diagnosis, it is believed that
              ML will also play an important role in surgery and interventional
              treatments. In particular, ML could become a game changer into
              the conception of cognitive surgical robots. Such robots endowed
              with cognitive skills would assist the surgical team also on a
              cognitive level, such as possibly lowering the mental load of the
              team. For example, ML could help extracting surgical skill,
              learned through demonstration by human experts, and could
              transfer this to robotic skills. Such intelligent surgical
              assistance would significantly surpass the state of the art in
              surgical robotics. Current devices possess no intelligence
              whatsoever and are merely advanced and expensive instruments.",

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Computer-assisted interventions for enhanced minimally
              invasive surgery (MIS) require tracking of the surgical
              instruments. Instrument tracking is a challenging problem in both
              conventional and robotic-assisted MIS, but vision-based
              approaches are a promising solution with minimal hardware
              integration requirements. However, vision-based methods suffer
              from drift, and in the case of occlusions, shadows and fast
              motion, they can be subject to complete tracking failure.
              METHODS: In this paper, we develop a 2D tracker based on a
              Generalized Hough Transform using SIFT features which can both
              handle complex environmental changes and recover from tracking
              failure. We use this to initialize a 3D tracker at each frame
              which enables us to recover 3D instrument pose over long
              sequences and even during occlusions. RESULTS: We quantitatively
              validate our method in 2D and 3D with ex vivo data collected from
              a DVRK controller as well as providing qualitative validation on
              robotic-assisted in vivo data. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate from
              our extended sequences that our method provides drift-free robust
              and accurate tracking. Our occlusion-based sequences additionally
              demonstrate that our method can recover from occlusion-based
              failure. In both cases, we show an improvement over using 3D
              tracking alone suggesting that combining 2D and 3D tracking is a
              promising solution to challenges in surgical instrument tracking.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: The manual generation of training data for the semantic
               segmentation of medical images using deep neural networks is a
               time-consuming and error-prone task. In this paper, we
               investigate the effect of different levels of realism on the
               training of deep neural networks for semantic segmentation of
               robotic instruments. An interactive virtual-reality environment
               was developed to generate synthetic images for robot-aided
               endoscopic surgery. In contrast with earlier works, we use
               physically based rendering for increased realism. METHODS: Using
               a virtual reality simulator that replicates our robotic setup,
               three synthetic image databases with an increasing level of
               realism were generated: flat, basic, and realistic (using the
               physically-based rendering). Each of those databases was used to
               train 20 instances of a UNet-based semantic-segmentation
               deep-learning model. The networks trained with only synthetic
               images were evaluated on the segmentation of 160 endoscopic
               images of a phantom. The networks were compared using the
               Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner nonparametric test. RESULTS: Our
               results show that the levels of realism increased the mean
               intersection-over-union (mIoU) of the networks on endoscopic
               images of a phantom ([Formula: see text]). The median mIoU
               values were 0.235 for the flat dataset, 0.458 for the basic, and
               0.729 for the realistic. All the networks trained with synthetic
               images outperformed naive classifiers. Moreover, in an ablation
               study, we show that the mIoU of physically based rendering is
               superior to texture mapping ([Formula: see text]) of the
               instrument (0.606), the background (0.685), and the background
               and instruments combined (0.672). CONCLUSIONS: Using
               physical-based rendering to generate synthetic images is an
               effective approach to improve the training of neural networks
               for the semantic segmentation of surgical instruments in
               endoscopic images. Our results show that this strategy can be an
               essential step in the broad applicability of deep neural

  abstract = "PURPOSE: Automation of sub-tasks during robotic surgery is
              challenging due to the high variability of the surgical scenes
              intra- and inter-patients. For example, the pick and place task
              can be executed different times during the same operation and for
              distinct purposes. Hence, designing automation solutions that can
              generalise a skill over different contexts becomes hard. All the
              experiments are conducted using the Pneumatic Attachable Flexible
              (PAF) rail, a novel surgical tool designed for robotic-assisted
              intraoperative organ manipulation. METHODS: We build upon
              previous open-source surgical Reinforcement Learning (RL)
              training environment to develop a new RL framework for
              manipulation skills, rlman. In rlman, contextual RL agents are
              trained to solve different aspects of the pick and place task
              using the PAF rail system. rlman is implemented to support both
              low- and high-dimensional state information to solve surgical
              sub-tasks in a simulation environment. RESULTS: We use rlman to
              train state of the art RL agents to solve four different surgical
              sub-tasks involving manipulation skills using the PAF rail. We
              compare the results with state-of-the-art benchmarks found in the
              literature. We evaluate the ability of the agent to be able to
              generalise over different aspects of the targeted surgical
              environment. CONCLUSION: We have shown that the rlman framework
              can support the training of different RL algorithms for solving
              surgical sub-task, analysing the importance of context
              information for generalisation capabilities. We are aiming to
              deploy the trained policy on the real da Vinci using the dVRK and
              show that the generalisation of the trained policy can be
              transferred to the real world.",

               assess the safety and benefit of laparoscopic resection compared
               with open resection for curative treatment of patients with
               cancer of the right or left colon. METHODS: 627 patients were
               randomly assigned to laparoscopic surgery and 621 patients to
               open surgery. The primary endpoint was cancer-free survival 3
               years after surgery. Secondary outcomes were short-term
               morbidity and mortality, number of positive resection margins,
               local recurrence, port-site or wound-site recurrence,
               metastasis, overall survival, and blood loss during surgery.
               Analysis was by intention to treat. Here, clinical
               characteristics, operative findings, and postoperative outcome
               are reported. FINDINGS: Patients assigned laparoscopic resection
               had less blood loss compared with those assigned open resection

  abstract  = "We present a coarse-to-fine dot array marker detection algorithm
               which can extract dot features with high accuracy and low
               uncertainty. The contribution of this paper is twofold: one is a
               configurable dot array marker detection framework which enables
               real-time multi-marker tracking with compact marker size (coarse
               detection); the other is a closed-form sub-pixel edge
               localization method including the formulation and the
               implementation (fine localization). The marker pattern together
               with the dot contours is detected in a fast but coarse way for
               efficiency consideration, using simple thresholding and
               hierarchical contour analysis. If the marker pattern matches
               with one of predefined marker descriptors, sub-pixel edge point
               localization of the dot contour is performed within the detected
               marker region by searching the zero-crossing in the convolution
               of the marker image with a Laplacian-of-Gaussian (LoG) kernel. A
               closed-form solution is proposed to localize the ``true'' edge
               point in a 3$\times$3 neighborhood of a candidate pixel by
               solving a quartic equation. The dot center is finally extracted
               by ellipse fitting and re-ordered according to an orientation
               indicator. The algorithm was evaluated against both synthetic
               and real image data, and also in real applications where stereo
               visual trackers were implemented using the proposed marker
               detection algorithm. Experimental results show that (1) the
               marker detection algorithm yielded a feature detection error of
               less than 0.1 pixel with real-time performance; (2) the
               uncertainties in both localizing static 2-D dot features and 3-D
               pose tracking were obviously reduced by performing the sub-pixel
               localization; and (3) the feasibility of the marker tracking

              However, the needle interacts with the surrounding tissue during
              insertion and deflects away from its intended trajectory. To
              overcome this problem, a significant research effort has been

  abstract = "The term electrosurgery (also called radiofrequency surgery)
              refers to the passage of high-frequency alternating electrical
              current through the tissue in order to achieve a specific
              surgical effect. Although the mechanism behind electrosurgery is
              not completely understood, heat production and thermal tissue
              damage is responsible for at least the majority--if not all--of
              the tissue effects in electrosurgery. Adjacent to the active
              electrode, tissue resistance to the passage of current converts
              electrical energy to heat. The only variable that determines the
              final tissue effects of a current is the depth and the rate at
              which heat is produced. Electrocoagulation occurs when tissue is
              heated below the boiling point and undergoes thermal
              denaturation. An additional slow increase in temperature leads to
              vaporization of the water content in the coagulated tissue and
              tissue drying, a process called desiccation. A sudden increase in

               experiences using a real-time 3-dimensional (3D) virtual reality
               navigation system with open MRI for breast-conserving surgery.
               STUDY DESIGN: We developed a real-time 3D virtual reality
               navigation system with open MRI, and evaluated the mismatch
               between the navigation system and real distance using a 3D
               phantom. Two patients with nonpalpable MRI-detected breast
               tumors underwent breast-conserving surgery under the guidance of
               the navigation system. An initial MRI for the breast tumor using
               skin-affixed markers was performed immediately before excision.
               A percutaneous intramammary dye marker was applied to delineate
               an excision line, and the computer software ``3D Slicer''
               generated a real-time 3D virtual reality model of the tumor and
               the puncture needle in the breast. Excision of the tumor was
               performed in the usual manner along the excision line indicated
               with the dye. The resected specimens were carefully examined
               histopathologically. RESULTS: The mean mismatch between the
               navigation system and real distance was 2.01 +/- 0.32 mm when
               evaluated with the 3D phantom. Under guidance by the navigation
               system, a percutaneous intramammary dye marker was applied
               without any difficulty. Fiducial registration errors were 3.00
               mm for patient no. 1, and 4.07 mm for patient no. 2.
               Histopathological examinations of the resected specimens of the
               2 patients showed noninvasive ductal carcinoma in situ. The
               surgical margins were free of carcinoma cells. CONCLUSIONS:
               Real-time 3D virtual reality navigation system with open MRI is
               feasible for safe and accurate excision of nonpalpable
               MRI-detected breast tumors. Long-term outcomes of this technique

               augmented reality and automatic assessment of instrument

               method that builds on random forests and addresses the task by
               modelling the instrument as an articulated object. A
               multi-template tracker reduces the region of interest to a

               images, has been successfully applied to various tasks.
               Therefore, it may be suitable to apply them for robots to learn
               and perform daily activities like washing and folding clothes,
               cooking, and cleaning since such tasks are difficult for non-DRL

               robots remains very challenging because conventional DRL
               algorithms require a huge number of training samples for
               learning, which is arduous in real robots. To alleviate this

               learning stability with fewer samples. The proposed methods were

              of this study was to develop a series of structured tasks to
              objectively measure laparoscopic skills. This model was then used
              to test for the effects of level of training and practice on
              performance. METHODS: Forty-two subjects (6 each of surgical
              residents PGY1 to PGY5, 6 surgeons who practice laparoscopy and 6
              who do not) were evaluated. Each subject viewed a 20-minute
              introductory video, then was tested performing 7 laparoscopic
              tasks (peg transfers, pattern cutting, clip and divide,
              endolooping, mesh placement and fixation, suturing with
              intracorporeal or extracorporeal knots). Performance was measured
              using a scoring system rewarding precision and speed. Each
              candidate repeated all 7 tasks and was rescored. Data were
              analyzed by linear regression to assess the relationship of
              performance with level of residency training for each task, and
              by ANOVA with repeated measures to test for effects of level of
              training, of repetition, and of the interaction between level of
              training and repetition on overall performance. Student's t test
              was used to evaluate differences between laparoscopic and
              nonlaparoscopic surgeons and between each of these groups and the
              PGY 5 level of surgical residents. RESULTS: Significant
              predictors of overall performance were (a) level of training (P =
              0.002), (b) repetition (P < 0.0001), and (c) interaction between
              level of training and practice (P = 0.001). There was also a
              significant interaction between level of training and the
              specific task on performance scores (P = 0.006). When each task
              was evaluated individually for the 30 residents, 4 of the 7 tasks
              (tasks 1, 2, 6, 7) showed significant correlation between PGY
              level and score. A significant difference in performance scores
              between laparoscopic and nonlaparoscopic surgeons was seen for
              tasks 1, 2, and 6. CONCLUSIONS: A model was developed to evaluate
              laparoscopic skills. Construct validity was demonstrated by
              measuring significant improvement in performance with increasing
              residency training, and with practice. Further validation will

               more than 700 ICI-treated patient samples with clinical outcomes

               predictions based on other conventional ICI treatment
               biomarkers, such as ICI targets or tumor
               microenvironment-associated markers. This work presents a
               network-based method to effectively select
               immunotherapy-response-associated biomarkers that can make
               robust ML-based predictions for precision oncology.",

              used. However, robust evidence to conclude that laparoscopic
              surgery and open surgery have similar outcomes in rectal cancer
              is lacking. A trial was designed to compare 3-year rates of
              cancer recurrence in the pelvic or perineal area (locoregional
              recurrence) and survival after laparoscopic and open resection of
              rectal cancer. METHODS: In this international trial conducted in
              30 hospitals, we randomly assigned patients with a solitary
              adenocarcinoma of the rectum within 15 cm of the anal verge, not
              invading adjacent tissues, and without distant metastases to
              undergo either laparoscopic or open surgery in a 2:1 ratio. The
              primary end point was locoregional recurrence 3 years after the
              index surgery. Secondary end points included disease-free and
              overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 1044 patients were included
              (699 in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 345 in the
              open-surgery group). At 3 years, the locoregional recurrence rate
              was 5.0\% in the two groups (difference, 0 percentage points;
              90\% confidence interval [CI], -2.6 to 2.6). Disease-free
              survival rates were 74.8\% in the laparoscopic-surgery group and
              70.8\% in the open-surgery group (difference, 4.0 percentage
              points; 95\% CI, -1.9 to 9.9). Overall survival rates were 86.7\%
              in the laparoscopic-surgery group and 83.6\% in the open-surgery
              group (difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95\% CI, -1.6 to 7.8).
              CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic surgery in patients with rectal cancer
              was associated with rates of locoregional recurrence and

               polybutadiene/tackifying resin compatible blends have been
               studied in detail. Viscoelastic properties have been described
               through the variations of the complex shear modulus, G*(?), as a
               function of frequency, ? and peeling properties through the
               variations of peeling force (F) as a function of peeling rate
               (V). After showing the objective character of the peeling curves
               obtained, the variations of the peeling force and peeling
               geometry have been studied as a function of volume fraction of
               the tackifying resin. In this first paper, the analysis is
               focused on the first domain of the peeling curves, i.e. the
               cohesive fracture region. In this region, the peeling properties
               have been related to the viscoelastic properties in the terminal
               region of relaxation. It is shown that the longest relaxation
               time, $\tau$o, is a reducing parameter of the peeling curves, so
               a peeling master curve-which is independent of temperature,
               resin volume fraction and polymer molecular weight-may be
               defined. Furthermore, the variations of the test geometry as a
               function of peeling rate have been investigated: the variations
               of the radius of curvature of the aluminium foil have been
               analyzed with respect to the viscoelastic behavior of the
               adhesive, which in fact governs the test geometry. A detailed
               analysis of all these features leads to a model which allows one
               to calculate the peeling curves in the cohesive domain from the

               instruments moving in the operated body required by surgeons is
               a challenging problem. Tracking of surgical instruments by
               vision-based methods is quite lucrative, due to its flexible
               implementation via software-based control with no need to modify
               instruments or surgical workflow. METHODS: A MIS instrument is
               conventionally split into a shaft and end-effector portions,
               while a 2D/3D tracking-by-detection framework is proposed, which
               performs the shaft tracking followed by the end-effector one.
               The former portion is described by line features via the RANSAC
               scheme, while the latter is depicted by special image features
               based on deep learning through a well-trained convolutional
               neural network. RESULTS: The method verification in 2D and 3D
               formulation is performed through the experiments on ex-vivo
               video sequences, while qualitative validation on in-vivo video
               sequences is obtained. CONCLUSION: The proposed method provides
               robust and accurate tracking, which is confirmed by the

               sequences exceeds those of the available state-of -the-art

              cholecystectomy), Heller myotomy (3 studies), gastric bypass (4),
              gastrectomy (2), bariatric surgery (1), cholecystectomy (4),
              splenectomy (1), colorectal resection (7), and rectopexy (1).
              DVSS was found to be associated with fewer Heller myotomy-related
              perforations, a more rapid intestinal recovery time after
              gastrectomy-and therefore a shorter hospital stay, a shorter
              hospital stay following cholecystectomy (although the duration of
              surgery was longer), longer colorectal resection surgery times,
              and a larger number of conversions to open surgery during gastric
              bypass. CONCLUSIONS: The publications reviewed revealed DVSS to
              offer certain advantages with respect to Heller myotomy,
              gastrectomy, and cholecystectomy. However, these results should
              be interpreted with caution until randomized clinical trials are
              performed and, with respect to oncologic indications, studies
              include variables such as survival.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Laparoscopic colorectal resection is equivalent to
              open resection in a number of important areas. However, recent
              data have raised concern that intraoperative complications may be
              increased.We conducted a meta-analysis comparing intraoperative
              complication rates of laparoscopic and equivalent open colorectal
              resection. DATA SOURCES: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
              Trials, MEDLINE, and Embase databases were searched, as were
              relevant scientific meeting abstracts and reference lists of
              included articles. REVIEW METHODS: Randomized controlled trials
              (RCTs) evaluating laparoscopic versus open surgery for any
              colorectal indication were included. Exclusion criteria were:
              trials assessing hand-assisted resection, and trials that
              excluded conversions to open surgery. There were no restrictions
              on language. Data were entered on an intention-to-treat basis in
              prospectively designed tables with complications categorized per
              event as: total complications, haemorrhage, bowel injury, and
              solid organ injury. Corresponding authors were contacted if
              information was missing. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used
              for assessing risk of bias, the PETO odds ratio method was used
              for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Complete intraoperative complication
              data were obtained for 10 out of 30 included RCTs. Four thousand
              and fifty-five patients were analyzed; 2159 in the Laparoscopic
              Group and 1896 in the Open Group. There was a higher total
              intraoperative complication rate (OR 1.37, P = 0.010) and a
              higher rate of bowel injury in the Laparoscopic Group (OR 1.88, P
              = 0.020). There was no difference in the rate of intraoperative
              haemorrhage or solid organ injury. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic

               debridement: removing dead or damaged tissue fragments to allow
               the remaining healthy tissue to heal. We present an autonomous
               multilateral surgical debridement system using the Raven, an
               open-architecture surgical robot with two cable-driven 7 DOF
               arms. Our system combines stereo vision for 3D perception with
               trajopt, an optimization-based motion planner, and model
               predictive control (MPC). Laboratory experiments involving
               sensing, grasping, and removal of 120 fragments suggest that an
               autonomous surgical robot can achieve robustness comparable to
               human performance. Our robot system demonstrated the advantage
               of multilateral systems, as the autonomous execution was
               1.5$\times$ faster with two arms than with one; however, it was
               two to three times slower than a human. Execution speed could be
               improved with better state estimation that would allow more
               travel between MPC steps and fewer MPC replanning cycles. The
               three primary contributions of this paper are: (1) introducing
               debridement as a sub-task of interest for surgical robotics, (2)
               demonstrating the first reliable autonomous robot performance of

               surgical scissors and tissue gripper, to accurately cut a
               circular pattern on surgical gauze suspended at the corners.
               Accuracy of cutting depends on tensioning, wherein the gripper
               pinches a point on the gauze in R3 and pulls to induce and
               maintain tension in the material as cutting proceeds. An
               automated tensioning policy maps the current state of the gauze
               to output a direction of pulling as an action. The optimal
               tensioning policy depends on both the choice of pinch point and
               cutting trajectory. We explore the problem of learning a
               tensioning policy conditioned on specific cutting trajectories.
               Every timestep, we allow the gripper to react to the deformation
               of the gauze and progress of the cutting trajectory with a
               translation unit vector along an allowable set of directions. As

               due to inherent nOnlinearities in cable-driven systems. We
               propose and evaluate a novel two-phase coarse-to-fine
               calibration method. In Phase I (coarse), we place a red
               calibration marker on the end effector and let it randomly move
               through a set of open-loop trajectories to obtain a large sample
               set of camera pixels and internal robot end-effector
               configurations. This coarse data is then used to train a Deep
               Neural Network (DNN) to learn the coarse transformation bias. In
               Phase II (fine), the bias from Phase I is applied to move the
               end -effector toward a small set of specific target points on a
               printed sheet. For each target, a human operator manually
               adjusts the end -effector position by direct contact (not
               through teleoperation) and the residual compensation bias is
               recorded. This fine data is then used to train a Random Forest
               (RF) to learn the fine transformation bias. Subsequent
               experiments suggest that without calibration, position errors
               average 4.55mm. Phase I can reduce average error to 2.14mm and
               the combination of Phase I and Phase II can reduces average
               error to 1.08mm. We apply these results to debridement of

               Furthermore, learning end-to-end manipulation policies directly

               surgeon's fatigue. Recent learning-based methods, especially
               reinforcement learning (RL) based methods, achieve promising
               performance for dexterous manipulation, which usually requires
               the simulation to collect data efficiently and reduce the
               hardware cost. The existing learning-based simulation platforms
               for medical robots suffer from limited scenarios and simplified
               physical interactions, which degrades the real-world performance
               of learned policies. In this work, we designed SurRoL, an
               RL-centered simulation platform for surgical robot learning
               compatible with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). The designed
               SurRoL integrates a user-friendly RL library for algorithm
               development and a real-time physics engine, which is able to
               support more PSM/ECM scenarios and more realistic physical
               interactions. Ten learning-based surgical tasks are built in the
               platform, which are common in the real autonomous surgical
               execution. We evaluate SurRoL using RL algorithms in simulation,
               provide in-depth analysis, deploy the trained policies on the
               real dVRK, and show that our SurRoL achieves better

               problems, given a rough CAD model of parts of the real scene. It
               does not require a controlled environment, for example placing
               markers. It handles arbitrarily complex models, occlusions,
               large camera displacements and drastic aspect changes. This is
               made possible by two major contributions: the first one is a
               fast recognition method that detects the known part of the
               scene, registers the camera with respect to it, and initializes
               a real-time tracker, which is the second contribution. Our
               tracker eliminates drift and jitter by merging the information
               from preceding frames in a traditional recursive tracking
               fashion with that of a very limited number of key-frames created

              spot is a key task during surgery, or else over discharge of
              blood will endanger a patient's life. However, the repetitive
              manual blood removal involves plenty of workload contributing
              fatigue of surgeons. Thus, it is valuable to design a robotic
              system which can automatically remove blood on the incision
              surface. Methods: In this paper, we design a robotic system to
              fulfill the surgical task of the blood removal. The system
              consists of a pair of dual cameras, a 6-DoF robotic arm, an
              aspirator whose handle is fixed to a robotic arm, and a pump
              connected to the aspirator. Further, a path-planning algorithm is
              designed to generate a path, which the aspirator tip should
              follow to remove blood. Results: In a group of simulating
              bleeding experiments on ex vivo porcine tissue, the contour of
              the blood region is detected, and the reconstructed spatial
              coordinates of the detected blood contour is obtained afterward.

              method of reducing surgical trauma and significantly improving

              instruments used in MIS, especially for laparoscopy, requires a
              long period of training and depends highly on the experience of
              surgeons. This letter presents a new robot-assisted surgical

              of surgeons through intrapractice feedback and demonstration from
              both human experts and reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This
              system utilizes proximal policy optimization to learn the control
              policy in simulation. Subsequently, a generative adversarial
              imitation learning agent is trained based on both expert
              demonstrations and learned policies in simulation. This agent
              then generates demonstration policies on the robot-assisted

              To further acquire surgical tools coordinates and encourage
              self-oriented practice, a mask region-based convolution neural
              network is trained to perform the semantic segmentation of
              surgical tools and targets. To the best of our knowledge, this

               for pedestrians up to 45 m from the cameras (urban intersection

               arbitrarily translated with additional noise, resulting in a
               cluster of the second point set. The goal is to compute k
               translations and a matching that minimizes the sum of squared
               distances between corresponding pairs of points. This is a
               fundamental problem for tracking systems (e.g., OptiTrack or
               Vicon) where the user registers k objects (rigid bodies) by
               attaching a set of markers to each object. Based on the position
               of these markers in real time, the system estimates the position
               of the moving objects by simultaneously clustering, matching,
               and transforming the n observed markers to the k objects.
               Similarly, an autonomous robot equipped with a camera may
               estimate its position by tracking n visual features from k
               recognized objects. The result can be used as a seeding
               clustering for existing algorithms, e.g., to compute the optimal

              critical surgical task of controlling tissue and blood vessel

              leveraging this capability in automating multilateral surgical

              benefits of considering this parallelism capability in developing
              execution models for autonomous robotic surgery. We apply our
              work to two surgical subtask categories: (i) coupled-motion
              subtasks, where multiple robot arms share the same resources to
              perform the subtask, and (ii) decoupled-motion subtasks, where
              each robot arm executes its part of the task independently from
              the others. We propose and develop parallel execution models for
              the surgical debridement subtask, a representative of the first
              category, and the multi-throw suturing subtask, a representative
              of the second one. Comparing these parallel execution models to
              the state-of-the-art ones shows significant reductions in the
              subtasks completion time by at least 40\%. In 20 trials, our
              results show that our proposed model for the surgical debridement
              subtask, that uses hierarchical concurrent state machines,
              provides a parallel execution framework that is efficient while
              greatly reducing collisions between the arms compared to a naive
              parallel execution model without coordination. We also show how
              applying parallelism can lead to execution models that go beyond

              environment, which has to be deduced from measurements collected
              during task execution. In this work, we propose to automate
              tissue dissection tasks by introducing a convolutional neural
              network, called BA-Net, to predict the location of attachment
              points between adjacent tissues. BA-Net identifies the attachment
              areas from a single partial view of the deformed surface, without
              any a-priori knowledge about their location. The proposed method
              guarantees a very fast prediction time, which makes it ideal for
              intra-operative applications. Experimental validation is carried
              out on both simulated and real world phantom data of soft tissue
              manipulation performed with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). The
              obtained results demonstrate that BA-Net provides robust
              predictions at varying geometric configurations, material
              properties, distributions of attachment points and grasping point
              locations. The estimation of attachment points provided by BA-Net

              system is acting, leading to a median simulation error below 5 mm
              in all the tested conditions. BA-Net can thus further support an
              ARS by providing a more robust test bench for the robotic actions

              are challenging for a robot when little or no knowledge about an

              asymmetric lengthening and mutual contacts. Consequently, the
              D-PneuNets actuator can generate relatively large force, and also
              provide compactness when not in use. Experiment and finite
              element analysis results show that the D-PneuNets actuator can
              grow more than 2.5 times of its initial height, and generate an

              allocations and low-level trajectories that optimize for
              legibility, fairness, or a combination of both objectives. We
              then test our resulting algorithm across studies where humans
              watch or play with robot teams. We find that our approach to
              generating legible teams makes the human's role clear, and that
              humans typically prefer to join and collaborate with legible
              teams instead of teams that only optimize for efficiency.
              Incorporating fairness alongside legibility further encourages
              participation: when humans play with robots, we find that they
              prefer (potentially inefficient) teams where the subtasks or
              effort are evenly divided. See videos of our studies here:

              a robot to quickly learn to perform instance grasping for new,
              previously unseen objects remains challenging. In this work, we
              present an instance grasping meta-learning framework (IGML), a
              simple yet effective end-to-end approach that not only teaches
              robots to identify novel objects but also how to grasp them.
              Given only a few examples to specify the grasping point of the
              target object, our IGML can quickly learn to recognize the target
              object and grasp it at the demonstrated grasping point by
              leveraging prior experience. Experimental results on the test
              sets show that IGML achieves decent success rates in cluttered
              environments, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art methods.
              Then we deployed IGML on a UR5 robot arm to handle pick-and-place

              small data regime is still a long-lasting problem for learning
              from demonstrations (LfD). A promising solution is meta-learning.
              However, we notice that simply constructing a model with a more
              complicated and deeper network via previous meta-learning methods
              does not perform well as we expected. One possible reason is that
              the shallow features are gradually lost as the network deepens,
              while these shallow features play an essential role in the
              adaptation process of meta-learning. Thus, we present a novel yet
              effective Multi-Level and Multi-Attention Domain-Adaptive
              Domain-Adaptive Meta-Learning (MLMA-DAML) framework, which
              meta-learns multiple visual features via different attention

              MLMA-DAML++. The proposed MLMA-DAML++ learns an effective

              network with convolutional layers (CL) to predict more reliable
              robot actions (represented by feature pixels/grids). Extensive

               deformations of the soft robot, its actuators, and surroundings
               when deformable. To find the inverse model of the robot
               interacting with obstacles, and with constraints on its
               actuators, we write the problem as a quadratic program with
               complementarity constraints. The novelty of this work is that
               friction contacts (sticking contact only) are taken into account
               in the optimization process, allowing the control of these
               specific tasks that are locomotion and manipulation. We propose
               a formulation that simplifies the optimization problem, together

               increase cutting accuracy measured by the symmetric difference

              of solving for the correct input torques to apply to the joints
              for a set of specified positions, velocities, and accelerations.
              Since the manipulator is a nonlinear system whose joints are
              highly coupled, it is very difficult to control. This paper
              presents a technique which adopts the idea of ``inverse problem''
              and extends the results of ``resolved-motion-rate'' controls. The
              method deals directly with the position and orientation of the
              hand. It differs from others in that accelerations are specified
              and that all the feedback control is done at the hand level. The
              control algorithm is shown to be asymptotically convergent. A PDP
              11/45 computer is used as part of a controller which computes the
              input torques/forces at each sampling period for the control
              system using the Newton-Euler formulation of equations of motion.
              The program is written in floating point assembly language, and

              to haptic display of scissor cutting are based on recording and

              based on the concepts of contact mechanics and fracture mechanics
              to calculate forces applied to scissors during cutting of a slab
              of material. The model considers the process of cutting as a
              sequence of deformation and fracture phases. During deformation
              phases, forces applied to the scissors are calculated from a
              torque-angle response model synthesized from measurement data
              multiplied by a ratio that depends on the position of the cutting
              crack edge and the curve of the blades. Using the principle of
              conservation of energy, the forces of fracture are related to the
              fracture toughness of the material and the geometry of the blades

               to create 3D models that are both quantitatively accurate as
               well as visually pleasing. For each small homogeneous patch in
               the image, we use a Markov Random Field (MRF) to infer a set of

              method is suitable for practical Augmented Reality applications
              including industrial environments. At the core of our approach is
              a novel representation for the 3D pose of object parts: We
              predict the 3D pose of each part in the form of the 2D
              projections of a few control points. The advantages of this
              representation is three-fold: We can predict the 3D pose of the
              object even when only one part is visible; when several parts are
              visible, we can easily combine them to compute a better pose of
              the object; the 3D pose we obtain is usually very accurate, even
              when only few parts are visible. We show how to use this

              bring the instrument at a desired three-dimensional location from
              an unknown or hidden position. Light-emitting diodes are attached
              on the tip of the instrument, and a specific instrument holder
              fitted with optical fibers is used to project laser dots on the
              surface of the organs. These optical markers are detected in the
              endoscopic image and allow localizing the instrument with respect
              to the scene. The instrument is recovered and centered in the
              image plane by means of a visual servoing algorithm using feature
              errors in the image. With this system, the surgeon can specify a

                     complications or mortal cases associated with misjudgments
                     of surgeons. Actually, specific accidents in MIS have been
                     increasing, but there is no efficient methodology of
                     quantitative analysis for accidents, even the standard
                     format for surgical record including operative procedure.
                     We therefore developed the surgery recorder system
                     (Surgery Recorder in short), which gives clinical review
                     process an objective way of identifying the causes of
                     accidents. The concept of Surgery Recorder is based on the
                     ``flight recorder with voice / video recorder'' in the
                     operating theater. Surgery Recorder records surgery
                     information including position/orientation (P/O) and
                     force/torque (F/T) signals of surgical tools, an
                     endoscopic vision and surrounding sounds as well as vital
                     data of the patient in the operating theater (A/V
                     information). A prototype of laparoscopic forceps (SF-Mark
                     II) for P/O and F/T sensing was also developed with less
                     stress of the sensor weight at surgical operation. Then,
                     two types of pig experiments in vivo by an expert were
                     performed for investigating the rough forceps motion to
                     diaphragm and liver. The data from SF-Mark II is useful
                     for detecting the forceps force/motion information of the
                     tissue damage and the simultaneous verification of the A/V
                     information is very important to verify the surgeon's
                     intention level. The ability of Surgery Recorder for
                     quantitative postoperative analysis was introduced by two
                     types of pig experiments. \textbackslashtextcopyright2007

  abstract  = "Rapidly random-exploring tree (RRT) and its variants are very
               popular due to their ability to quickly and efficiently explore
               the state space. However, they suffer sensitivity to the initial
               solution and slow convergence to the optimal solution, which
               means that they consume a lot of memory and time to find the
               optimal path. It is critical to quickly find a short path in
               many applications such as the autonomous vehicle with limited
               power/fuel. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
               optimal path planning algorithm based on the convolutional
               neural network (CNN), namely the neural RRT∗ (NRRT∗). The NRRT∗
               utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution generated from a CNN
               model. The model is trained using quantities of successful path
               planning cases. In this article, we use the A∗ algorithm to
               generate the training data set consisting of the map information
               and the optimal path. For a given task, the proposed CNN model
               can predict the probability distribution of the optimal path on
               the map, which is used to guide the sampling process. The time
               cost and memory usage of the planned path are selected as the
               metric to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the
               NRRT∗. The simulation results reveal that the NRRT∗ can achieve
               convincing performance compared with the state-of-The-Art path
               planning algorithms. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of
               this article stems from the need to develop a fast and efficient
               path planning algorithm for practical applications such as
               autonomous driving, warehouse robot, and countless others.
               Sampling-based algorithms are widely used in these areas due to
               their good scalability and high efficiency. However, the quality
               of the initial path is not guaranteed and it takes much time to
               converge to the optimal path. To quickly obtain a high-quality
               initial path and accelerate the convergence speed, we propose
               the NRRT∗. It utilizes a nonuniform sampling distribution and
               achieves better performance. The NRRT∗ can be also applied to
               other sampling-based algorithms for improved results in
               different applications.",

              improve depth perception. However, it is a question whether 3D
              vision can improve motion in the depth direction. The aim of this
              study was to compare the impact of 3D vision on forceps motion in
              the depth and horizontal directions. METHODS: All data were
              obtained from our previous two studies, where, in total, 40
              novices and 20 moderately experienced surgeons participated. A
              simple phantom task was performed in a training box. The
              participants were randomly assigned to two groups. Specifically,
              one group performed the task five times initially under a
              two-dimensional (2D) system, and the other group started under a
              3D system. Both groups then performed the same task five times

              optical position tracker. We separately evaluated forceps motion
              in the x-, y-, and z-axis directions. RESULTS: Compared with the
              findings for 2D vision, the forceps path lengths were
              significantly decreased among novices and moderately experienced
              surgeons in almost all tasks under 3D vision. In a comparison of
              the path length ratio (3D/2D) in each direction, larger reduction
              was observed for the depth direction among novices, whereas no
              significant directional difference was noted among moderately
              experienced surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: For novices, 3D laparoscopic
              vision improves depth perception and may give shorter forceps
              movement in the depth direction even for simple tasks.",

               good agreement. The temperature- and compression-dependent
               electrical conductivity has a significant effect on temperature
               profiles. In comparison, the temperature-dependent thermal

              soft-tissue surgery task because it requires intricate imaging,

              precise execution via highly adaptable control strategies often
              in unstructured and deformable environments. In the laparoscopic

              need for high maneuverability and repeatability under motion and
              vision constraints. Here we describe an enhanced autonomous

              robotic laparoscopic small bowel anastomosis in phantom and in

               surgical tools with advanced sensory and diagnostic capabilities
               are only available. A major criticism towards the newly
               developed instruments that they are not fitting into the
               existing medical workflow often creating more annoyance than
               benefit for the surgeon. The first step in achieving streamlined
               integration of computer technologies is gaining a better
               understanding of the SP. Surgical ontologies provide a generic
               platform for describing elements of the surgical procedures.
               Surgical Process Models (SPMs) built on top of these ontologies
               have the potential to accurately represent the surgical
               workflow. SPMs provide the opportunity to use ontological terms
               as the basis of automation, allowing the developed algorithm to
               easily integrate into the surgical workflow, and to apply the
               automated SPMs wherever the linked ontological term appears in
               the workflow. In this work, as an example to this concept, the
               subtask level ontological term ?blunt dissection? was targeted
               for automation. We implemented a computer vision-driven approach
               to demonstrate that automation on this task level is feasible.
               The algorithm was tested on an experimental silicone phantom as
               well as in several ex vivo environments. The implementation used
               the da Vinci surgical robot, controlled via the Da Vinci
               Research Kit (DVRK), relying on a shared code-base among the
               DVRK institutions. It is believed that developing and linking
               further building blocks of lower level surgical subtasks could
               lead to the introduction of automated soft tissue surgery. In
               the future, the building blocks could be individually unit
               tested, leading to incremental automation of the domain. This

               human skeletons from RF signals. It requires no sensors on the
               body, and works with multiple people and across walls and
               occlusions. Further, it generates dynamic skeletons that follow
               the people as they move, walk or sit. As such, RF-Pose3D
               provides a significant leap in RF-based sensing and enables new
               applications in gaming, healthcare, and smart homes.RF-Pose3D is
               based on a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
               that performs high-dimensional convolutions by decomposing them
               into low-dimensional operations. This property allows the
               network to efficiently condense the spatio-temporal information
               in RF signals. The network first zooms in on the individuals in
               the scene, and crops the RF signals reflected off each person.
               For each individual, it localizes and tracks their body parts -
               head, shoulders, arms, wrists, hip, knees, and feet. Our
               evaluation results show that RF-Pose3D tracks each keypoint on

               introduced to split the continuum at crack surfaces, our methods
               are based on Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) with a variational
               energy-based formulation for crack evolution. Our first approach
               formulates the resulting dynamic material damage evolution with
               a Ginzburg-Landau type phase-field equation and discretizes it
               with the Material Point Method (MPM), resulting in a coupled
               momentum/damage solver rooted in phase field fracture: PFF-MPM.
               Although our PFF-MPM approach achieves convincing fracture with
               or without plasticity, we also introduce a return mapping
               algorithm that can be analytically solved for a wide range of
               general non-associated plasticity models, achieving more than
               two times speedup over traditional iterative approaches. To
               demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm, we also develop a

               fracture effects on its own. Though NACC and PFF can be

               is one of the hallmarks of human motor skills. From numerous
               behavioral studies, there is strong evidence that humans employ
               compliant task space control, i.e. they focus control only on
               task variables while keeping redundant degrees-of-freedom as
               compliant as possible. This strategy is robust towards unknown
               disturbances and simultaneously safe for the operator and the
               environment. The theory of operational space control in robotics
               aims to achieve similar performance properties. However, despite
               various compelling theoretical lines of research, advanced
               operational space control is hardly found in actual robotics
               implementations, in particular new kinds of robots like
               humanoids and service robots, which would strongly profit from
               compliant dexterous manipulation. To analyze the pros and cons
               of different approaches to operational space control, this paper
               focuses on a theoretical and empirical evaluation of different
               methods that have been suggested in the literature, but also
               some new variants of operational space controllers. We address
               formulations at the velocity, acceleration, and force levels.
               First, we formulate all controllers in a common notational
               framework, including quaternion-based orientation control, and
               discuss some of their theoretical properties. Second, we present

               ensures physical consistency, as this issue was crucial for our
               successful robot implementations. Our extensive empirical

               reward functions and subtask transition conditions. Over this
               approximation, SWIRL applies Q-learning to compute a policy that
               maximizes rewards. Experiments suggest that SWIRL requires
               significantly fewer rollouts than pure reinforcement learning
               and fewer expert demonstrations than behavioral cloning to learn
               a policy. We evaluate SWIRL in two simulated control tasks,
               parallel parking and a two-link pendulum. On the parallel
               parking task, SWIRL achieves the maximum reward on the task with
               85\% fewer rollouts than Q-learning, and one-eight of
               demonstrations needed by behavioral cloning. We also consider
               physical experiments on surgical tensioning and cutting
               deformable sheets using a da Vinci surgical robot. On the
               deformable tensioning task, SWIRL achieves a 36\% relative
               improvement in reward compared with a baseline of behavioral
               cloning with segmentation.",

              reinforcement learning (RL) for automating surgical maneuvers in
              a graphical simulation.Methods. In the Unity3D game engine, the
              Machine Learning-Agents package was integrated with the NVIDIA
              FleX particle simulator for developing autonomously behaving
              RL-trained scissors. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) was used
              to reward movements and desired behavior such as movement along
              desired trajectory and optimized cutting maneuvers along the
              deformable tissue-like object. Constant and proportional reward
              functions were tested, and TensorFlow analytics was used to
              informed hyperparameter tuning and evaluate performance.Results.
              RL-trained scissors reliably manipulated the rendered tissue that
              was simulated with soft-tissue properties. A desirable trajectory
              of the autonomously behaving scissors was achieved along 1 axis.
              Proportional rewards performed better compared to constant

               for unambiguous, compact, singularity free, computationally
               efficient method for representing rotational information is
               imposed. As a solution, unit quaternions are proposed and
               kinematic modeling in dual quaternion space arose. In this
               paper, an overview of spatial descriptions and transformations
               that can be applied together within these spaces in order to
               solve kinematic problems is presented. Special emphasis is on a
               different mathematical formalisms used to represent attitude of
               a rigid body such as rotation matrix, Euler angles, axis-angle
               representation, unit quaternions, and their mutual relation.
               Benefits of kinematic modeling in quaternion space are
               presented. New direct kinematics algorithm in dual quaternion
               space pertaining to a particular manipulator is given. These
               constructs and algorithms are demonstrated on the human
               centrifuge as 3 DoF robot manipulator.

  title     = "A method for calculating angle-axis vector at singular points
               and a proposal of extended angle-axis vector",
  author    = "Sekiguchi, Masanori and Takesue, Naoyuki",
  abstract  = "Angle-axis vector, which is also called axis-angle
               representation or rotation vector, can be applied to represent
               an orientation or orientation error with minimal three
               parameters. However, it has a problem about singular points.
               Therefore, this paper shows a method for calculating angle-axis
               vector at singular points. In addition, this paper proposes an
               extended angle-axis vector. Conventional angle-axis vector
               cannot represent an orientation error that is greater than $\pi$
               due to the range of inverse trigonometric function. The extended
               angle-axis vector can express the orientation that cannot be
               represented by the conventional method. The results of this
               study are expected to give a new method for expressing an
               orientation error which is needed for numerical solution of
               inverse kinematics or some attitude controls. 1. SO(3) 12

               used text on reinforcement learning, one of the most active
               research areas in artificial intelligence.Reinforcement
               learning, one of the most active research areas in artificial
               intelligence, is a computational approach to learning whereby an
               agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives
               while interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. In
               Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide
               a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and
               algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded
               and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of
               other topics.Like the first edition, this second edition focuses
               on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical
               material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of
               reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the
               tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many
               algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition,
               including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II
               extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections
               on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier
               basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and
               policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on
               reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and
               neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter
               including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM
               Watson's wagering strategy. The final chapter discusses the
               future societal impacts of reinforcement learning.",

               spatial 'pooling', where the outputs of several nearby feature
               detectors are combined into a local or global 'bag of features',
               in a way that preserves task-related information while removing
               irrelevant details. Pooling is used to achieve invariance to
               image transformations, more compact representations, and better
               robustness to noise and clutter. Several papers have shown that
               the details of the pooling operation can greatly influence the
               performance, but studies have so far been purely empirical. In
               this paper, we show that the reasons underlying the performance
               of various pooling methods are obscured by several confounding
               factors, such as the link between the sample cardinality in a
               spatial pool and the resolution at which low-level features have
               been extracted. We provide a detailed theoretical analysis of
               max pooling and average pooling, and give extensive empirical
               comparisons for object recognition tasks. Copyright 2010 by the

              strictly computer vision approach and the recent advances of deep
              learning. We propose an architecture using multimodal
              convolutional neural networks for fast detection and localization
              of tools in RAS videos. To our knowledge, this approach will be
              the first to incorporate deep neural networks for tool detection
              and localization in RAS videos. Our architecture applies a Region
              Proposal Network (RPN), and a multi-modal two stream
              convolutional network for object detection, to jointly predict
              objectness and localization on a fusion of image and temporal
              motion cues. Our results with an Average Precision (AP) of 91\%
              and a mean computation time of 0.1 seconds per test frame
              detection indicate that our study is superior to conventionally
              used methods for medical imaging while also emphasizing the
              benefits of using RPN for precision and efficiency. We also
              introduce a new dataset, ATLAS Dione, for RAS video
              understanding. Our dataset provides video data of ten surgeons
              from Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) (Buffalo, NY)
              performing six different surgical tasks on the daVinci Surgical
              System (dVSS™) with annotations of robotic tools per frame.",

  abstract  = "Model-based reinforcement learning approaches carry the promise
               of being data efficient. However, due to challenges in learning
               dynamics models that sufficiently match the real-world dynamics,
               they struggle to achieve the same asymptotic performance as
               model-free methods. We propose Model-Based
               Meta-Policy-Optimization (MB-MPO), an approach that foregoes the
               strong reliance on accurate learned dynamics models. Using an
               ensemble of learned dynamic models, MB-MPO meta-learns a policy
               that can quickly adapt to any model in the ensemble with one
               policy gradient step. This steers the meta-policy towards
               internalizing consistent dynamics predictions among the ensemble
               while shifting the burden of behaving optimally w.r.t. the model
               discrepancies towards the adaptation step. Our experiments show
               that MB-MPO is more robust to model imperfections than previous
               model-based approaches. Finally, we demonstrate that our
               approach is able to match the asymptotic performance of
               model-free methods while requiring significantly less

  abstract  = "Robotic assistance is becoming a standard in Minimally Invasive
               Surgery. Despite its clinical benefits and technical potential,
               surgeons still have to perform manu- ally a number of monotonous
               and time-consuming surgical subtasks, like knot-tying or blunt
               dissection. Many believe that the next bold step in the
               advancement of robotic surgery is the automation of such
               subtasks. Partial automation can reduce the cogni- tive load on
               surgeons, and support them in paying more attention to the
               critical elements of the surgical workflow. Our aim was to
               develop a software framework to ease and hasten the automation
               of surgical subtasks. This framework was built alongside the Da
               Vinci Research Kit (DVRK), while it can be ported onto other
               robotic platforms, since it is based on the Robot Operating
               System (ROS). The software includes both stereo vision-based and
               hierarchical motion planning, with a wide palette of often used
               surgi- cal gestures---such as grasping, cutting or soft tissue
               manipulation---as building blocks to support the high-level
               implementation of autonomous surgical subtask execution
               routines. This open-source surgical automation framework---named

               but interaction with deformable objects has notably lagged
               behind. Due to the large configuration space of deformable
               objects, solutions using traditional modelling approaches
               require significant engineering work. Perhaps then, bypassing
               the need for explicit modelling and instead learning the control
               in an end-to-end manner serves as a better approach? Despite the
               growing interest in the use of end-to-end robot learning
               approaches, only a small amount of work has focused on their
               applicability to deformable object manipulation. Moreover, due
               to the large amount of data needed to learn these end-to-end
               solutions, an emerging trend is to learn control policies in
               simulation and then transfer them over to the real world. To
               date, no work has explored whether it is possible to learn and
               transfer deformable object policies. We believe that if
               sim-to-real methods are to be employed further, then it should
               be possible to learn to interact with a wide variety of objects,
               and not only rigid objects. In this work, we use a combination
               of state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms to
               solve the problem of manipulating deformable objects
               (specifically cloth). We evaluate our approach on three
               tasks---folding a towel up to a mark, folding a face towel
               diagonally, and draping a piece of cloth over a hanger. Our
               agents are fully trained in simulation with domain
               randomisation, and then successfully deployed in the real world
               without having seen any real deformable objects.",

               a fixed set of predetermined object categories. This restricted
               form of supervision limits their generality and usability since
               additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual
               concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a
               promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of
               supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of
               predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient
               and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from
               scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs
               collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural
               language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or
               describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to
               downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by
               benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision
               datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in
               videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object
               classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks
               and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline
               without the need for any dataset specific training. For
               instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on
               ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28
               million training examples it was trained on.",

              photo-realistic scenes and fast and accurate rigid and deformable
              body simulation. With ORBIT, we provide a suite of benchmark
              tasks of varying difficulty -- from single-stage cabinet opening
              and cloth folding to multi-stage tasks such as room
              reorganization. To support working with diverse observations and
              action spaces, we include fixed-arm and mobile manipulators with
              different physically-based sensors and motion generators. ORBIT
              allows training reinforcement learning policies and collecting
              large demonstration datasets from hand-crafted or expert
              solutions in a matter of minutes by leveraging GPU-based
              parallelization. In summary, we offer an open-sourced framework
              that readily comes with 16 robotic platforms, 4 sensor
              modalities, 10 motion generators, more than 20 benchmark tasks,
              and wrappers to 4 learning libraries. With this framework, we aim

              learning, reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and task
              and motion planning. We hope it helps establish interdisciplinary
              collaborations in these communities, and its modularity makes it
              easily extensible for more tasks and applications in the future.

                  and executing semi-autonomous tissue retraction in minimally
                  invasive robotic surgery. The approach is aimed at removing
                  tissue flaps or connective tissue from the surgical area
                  autonomously, thus exposing the underlying anatomical
                  structures. First, a deep neural network is used to analyse
                  the endoscopic image and detect candidate tissue flaps
                  obstructing the surgical field. A procedural algorithm for
                  planning and executing the retraction gesture is then
                  developed from extended discussions with clinicians.
                  Experimental validation, carried out on a DaVinci Research
                  Kit, shows an average 25\% increase of the visible background
                  after retraction. Another significant contribution of this
                  letter is a dataset containing 1,080 labelled surgical stereo
                  images and the associated depth maps, representing tissue
                  flaps in different scenarios. The work described in this
                  letter is a fundamental step towards the autonomous execution
                  of tissue retraction, and the first example of simultaneous
                  use of deep learning and procedural algorithms. The same
                  framework could be applied to a wide range of autonomous
                  tasks, such as debridement and placement of laparoscopic
                  clips.",

              rigid objects. The targeted application domain is surgical
              training. This application relies more on visual realism than
              exact, patient-specific deformation, but requires that
              computations be performed in real time. This is in contrast with
              pre-operative surgical planning, where computations may be done
              offline but must provide accurate results. To achieve real-time
              performance, the proposed algorithms take advantage of the fact
              that most deformations are local, human-body tissues are well
              damped, and motions of surgical instruments are relatively slow.

               few-shot-imitation agents that we call demonstration-conditioned
               reinforcement learning (DCRL). Given a training set consisting
               of demonstrations, reward functions and transition distributions
               for multiple tasks, the idea is to work with a policy that takes
               demonstrations as input, and to train this policy to maximize
               the average of the cumulative reward over the set of training
               tasks. Relative to previously proposed few-shot imitation
               methods that use behaviour cloning or infer reward functions
               from demonstrations, our method has the disadvantage that it
               requires reward functions at training time. However, DCRL also
               has several advantages, such as the ability to improve upon
               suboptimal demonstrations, to operate given state-only
               demonstrations, and to cope with a domain shift between the
               demonstrator and the agent. Moreover, we show that DCRL
               outperforms methods based on behaviour cloning by a large
               margin, on navigation tasks and on robotic manipulation tasks
               from the Meta-World benchmark.",
